# Sparrows Dot Files

## Hello there!

Sharing is caring, so here are some dot files I configure to help my workflow and efficiency.  

Also included is a script to help keep your own repository of dot files version controlled. Since the script uses the force option is will override the existing files, allowing for a manual syncing process. I hope to improve on this in the future. In the mean time I hope these are useful to someone.

## The Script

### Adding files
For now the only target directory is $HOME, add your files in `target_home` and run the script from the root directory. `$ ./make-sym-links.sh`
